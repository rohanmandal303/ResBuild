## 💡 The Problem & Solution

Traditional recruitment involves manually reading hundreds of resumes to find a single qualified candidate, leading to fatigue, bias, and prolonged hiring cycles. 

**AI Resume Analyzer** solves this by automating the initial screening phase. By combining a premium, responsive user interface with advanced Natural Language Processing (via Google Gemini AI), the platform reads resumes, compares them contextually against job descriptions, and outputs a highly accurate compatibility score alongside actionable insights.

## 🚀 Key Technical Achievements

- **Seamless AI Integration:** Engineered a robust backend service that integrates `@google/generative-ai` to perform complex, contextual analysis of unstructured PDF parsing data, mapping raw text to structured JSON assessments.
- **High-Performance UI/UX:** Built with React 19, Vite, and TailwindCSS 4, featuring a "zero-loading-state perception" through optimistic UI updates, Framer Motion animations, and custom skeleton loaders.
- **Actionable Data Visualization:** Implemented dynamic real-time recruitment dashboards using Recharts, presenting complex datasets (skills distribution, application volume trends) in an easily digestible format.
- **Robust Full-Stack Architecture:** Designed a scalable MERN stack application utilizing a clear separation of concerns (Controllers, Routes, Services) and secure, RESTful endpoints.
